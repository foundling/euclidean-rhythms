improvements:
  implement sequence as a circular array with a rotation degree to avoid shifting elements.

bugs:
  
  bulk update works for pitch, but not for envelope data

sequencer:
  sequence direction:
    solo/mute channel
    manually add/subtract a pulse
    random pulse distribution
    per step/track octave buttons (that mutate underlying step data)

  bulk select/deselect:
    shift click on a pulse in order to bulk edit. takes the target note, and copies all of the values for that step to the others.

  note selector:
    play note when we click on note selector 
    give sharped notes different collor

todo:
  mute track when active track is clicked, unmute
  offer a pre-existing list of pattern configs to choose from
  manual
  color coded guide. choose colors friendly to people w/ colorblindness.
  rename source/tempo to two word names, per Vue best practices
  fix ui color priorities so it's easier to use at first 
  convert play controls to separate component, then nest that and Tempo inside of Transport, so you can
  remove complexity in grandchild -> grandparent communication of tempo change.
