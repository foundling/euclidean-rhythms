Bugs
~~~~

- multiple tracks with rotation & reverse ends up skipping steps in active layer's UI? 
  - no discernible playback problem.
  - stopping and restarting sequence (no reload) resolves this.

- bulk edit works for notes, but not for ADSR settings
- if you rotate a sequence and then increment the 'k', the rotation is lost.
